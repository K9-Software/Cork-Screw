## I am working on:

 1. #####  [Mavric](https://k9-software.github.io/Mavric-Antimalware-Protection)(The Antivirus and Antimalware Program)
###### The whole idea for Mavric was to have a user-customized Antimalware AND Antivirus in one program, which means polls will be held for features from the Mavric team and you, so Mavric starts as a Sophisticated, Fast, and Powerful Scanner for Windows 10+ with anti-ransomware Tools powered by other Antivirus Engines.
> ###### Pros:
 ###### **Anti-ransomware Tools(_From a lot of other Antiviruses_)**
 ###### **Fast**
 ###### **Powerful**
 ###### **Hashes**
> ###### Cons:
  ###### **Bugs**
 2. #####  Nexus(A Site of my Best Software)
###### Made of Jpex(My Own Programming language), BaRS(Backup and Restore Software), DBaRs(Driver Backup and Restore Software), PFA(Phone File Accessor), and Mavric(The Antivirus and Antimalware Program).
 3. #####  Jpex(My Own Programming language)
###### Not much to say.
4. #####  BaRS(Backup and Restore Software)
###### Not much to say, but has Realtime Backups.
5. #####  PFA
###### Not much to say.
